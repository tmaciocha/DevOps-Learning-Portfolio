# list_users.sh 

This is my first Bash automation script created as part of my DevOps learning journey.

## What does is do
It reads the `/etc/passwd/` file, extracts the list of system users, and displays their usernames with their home directories. Just simple `awk`.

## Sample output
john /home/john
anna /home/anna
promet /home/promet
